# Is substring

Given two strings implement a method which determines whether the characters in the `second` string is a substring of
the characters in the `first` string (check if `second` string exists as continuous/unbroken chain of characters the
`first` string).

## Limitations

Don't use `contains` method on `String` class.

## Examples

```
isSubstring("go home", "ome") // true

isSubstring("go home", "me") // true

isSubstring("go home", "abc") // false
```


## Getting Started

This repository contains a class that returns true. Replace the body of the class with an implementation which will 
return true or false to satisfy the above criteria. We have already created some tests (JUnit5) which need to pass.

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a branch
3. Write the implementation 
4. Commit your code with a suitable commit message
5. Create a pull request
